# multiomics
Measuring all the things

## Benchmark datasets and interoperability

Ideally: Has both sequencing-based and imaging-based molecular measurements

- Brain Initiative is doing RNA-Seq + imaging + epigenomics on single cells from the brain region
- ENCODE is doing hematopoiesis and liver
- HCA also has its own

### Need interoperability

- Every of these grants have a DCP
- Should be working at the "node level" to latch onto these existing initiatives to make sure all their data types are interoperable
