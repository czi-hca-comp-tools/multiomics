# multireckoning
Measuring all the things

## What *is* multireckoning?

- DNA-seq of an individual + RNA-seq
- RNA-Seq + ATAC-seq on similar populations (not necessarily identical cells). Are there relationships between accessible chromatin and RNA that influences gene expression?
- RNA-seq + imaging on similar populations
- RNA-seq + imaging on the SAME cells (via infrared imaging)
- 10X RNA-seq and Smart-seq2 on similar populations. 

## Our goal

The goal of this repo is to collect a list of interesting multireckoning situations, datasets, and algorithms.  Our hope is that by centralizing ideas across the broad compass of multireckoning we can start to understand what we can learn from each other.  

## Data

Here we will collect links to datasets available in the https://github.com/czi-hca-comp-tools/easy-data repo that involve multireckoning problems.

## Concepts

Here we will collect links to papers/preprints/whitepapers from our group, articulating ways of dealing with multireckoning situations.  

## Extra links

Here we will collect extra links that may be of interest, including datasets and papers published by people outside our group that may have bearing on multireckoning problems.
