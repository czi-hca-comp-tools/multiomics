Measuring all the things





Potential to-do's:
1) Ask DCP if their ingestion service can accommodate ingesting "planned" data: that is, an entry that consists of all metadata but lacking the actual data content, plus a date for when it will likely be available. That way, when everybody searches DCP for a particular data type, they see not just data that exists but also data that is coming in the future. This means a metadata field that contains either "Data exists" or "Estimated date data will exist". 
2) Each project that has its own place for data to exist (e.g. Brain Initiative) needs to contact HCA and decide how to interface with HCA's DCP so as to decide whether to duplicate the data or interface.
